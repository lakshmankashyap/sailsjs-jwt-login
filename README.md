# Sails JWT Starter

[Sails](http://sailsjs.org) + JWT + Angular + Bulma = Awesome

This repo is an example of using SailsJS, an Angular frontend, JWT and the awesome [bulma](http://bulma.io) CSS framework. It contains signup, login and reset popup and a very simple skeleton page base upon the [free bulma templates](https://dansup.github.io/bulma-templates/).

### Installation
Install the latest sails : http://sailsjs.org/get-started.

Then, inside the app folder:

```
$ npm install
$ sails lift
```

All going well you should see a page with a login signup button.

Please Note: Emailing of the reset details is not currently implemented.
